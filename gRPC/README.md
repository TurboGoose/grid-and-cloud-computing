# gRPC assignment
## Formulation
Using grpc, create an API to query a database/storage of your choice (SQL, Redis, etc.). API should have the following methods:
- get item by id
- put item
- delete item by id
- get many items (with paging - you provide a page number and page length)

The API code should be generated from a proto file, you should be able to demonstrate querying this API from another application.
